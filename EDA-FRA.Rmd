Hi folks.
* Update rmarkdown and evaluate packages.
Been trying to understand the difference across variables for default classes.

###Crude Balancing
As you know, the training dataset is imbalanced in favor of <code>Did Not Default</code>.
So the dataset was, for the lack of a better term, <i>crudely</i> balanced like so:

* All <code>Did Default</code> cases were pushed into a new training set.
* The <code>Did Not Default</code> cases were picked from random from the original set.

The final set had all the <code>Did Default</code> & 700 <code>Did Not Default</code> cases.

###Data Visualization


The <code>Number of Dependants</code> seems to be less for those who did default.

Whether this is due to imbalanced data or some other phenomenon needs to be explored.


The same can be said for <code>Number of Open Credit Lines & Loans</code>.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,plotly=TRUE,cache=FALSE, fig.align='center',results='markup'}

train=read.csv("train.csv",header=TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpivotTable)
library(plotly)
#head(train)
p1=ggplot(train,aes(x=DV,y=DebtRatio))+geom_boxplot()
ggplotly(p1)
```
<code>Debt Ratio</code> for <cpde>No</code> cases are observed to be as high as 15K. What this means is that for these customers, debt payments are 15 times the gross income!! Even outside the context of default prediction, this is anomalous.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,plotly=TRUE,cache=FALSE, fig.align='center',results='markup'}
p2=ggplot(train,aes(x=DV,y=RevolvingUtilization))+geom_boxplot()
ggplotly(p2)
```
<code>Revolving Utilization Of Unsecured Lines</code> has extreme values way above 1. This means the total balance on credit cards and other credit lines far exceed the sum of credit limits available. This is meaningless. The data for these records is corrupt or incorrect. Either way, the records cannot be used.

Now this is done, we'll have to see if the anomalies exist in balanced data as well.
